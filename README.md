### hi, I’m Julia

I’m an incessantly curious human, currently studying computer science and network engineering. I love learning about technology, mathematics, liguistics, and philosophy.

### here is me right now

This is a living snapshot. A place to learn in public, follow my curiosity,
and share small things as they take shape.

**lately, I’ve been:**

- Exploring machine learning methods in my student research work
- In my third year studying Network Engineering, with a growing interest in how
  agentic AI can be applied in this space
- Building small, multimedia art projects (more to come)
- Learning slowly and intentionally, giving myself room to explore both
  technology and the human experience

**i'm currently reading:**

- _The Hour of the Star_ — Clarice Lispector
- _A Mind at Play_ — Rob Goodman & Jimmy Soni
- _Revolution in Poetic Language_ — Julia Kristeva
