### hi, I’m Julia

I’m an incessantly curious human, currently studying network engineering, with a
growing interest in machine learning and intelligent systems.

### here is me right now

This is a place to learn in public, follow my curiosity, and share small things as they take shape.

**lately, I’ve been:**
- Exploring machine learning methods (gradient boosting and CNNs) in my student research work
- In my third year studying network engineering, with a growing interest in how
  agentic AI can be applied in this space
- Building small, multimedia art projects (more to come)
- Learning slowly and intentionally, giving myself room to explore both
  technology and the human experience

**i’m currently reading:**
- _The Hour of the Star_ — Clarice Lispector
- _A Mind at Play_ — Rob Goodman & Jimmy Soni
- _Revolution in Poetic Language_ — Julia Kristeva
